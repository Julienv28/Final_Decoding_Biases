  <h1>Abstract</h1>
  <p> This study investigates algorithmic bias in AI facial recognition systems, focusing on gender <br><br>
    and age misclassification within the transgender community. Using a Caffe-based facial recognition model, <br><br>
    the research analyzes the performance of gender and age detection on a dataset of 207 individuals <br><br>
    (105 transgender, 102 cisgender). The results reveal significant disparities: transgender women are especially <br><br>
    vulnerable to misgendering, with only 12 out of 79 correctly classified as female, in stark contrast to trans men, <br><br>
     all of whom (26 out of 26) were correctly classified as male. Among cisgender individuals, the system accurately <br><br>
     identified 48 out of 49 men, but only 5 out of 53 women. Age estimation was also generally inaccurate. </p>
  <p>The model tended to predict lower average ages while exhibiting a broader distribution, often overestimating <br><br>
    the maximum age, particularly for men. These findings demonstrate that facial recognition algorithms misgender and <br><br>
    misage transgender individuals at a higher rate than cisgender individuals, with women, both cis and trans, most <br><br>
    frequently misclassified. The results align with previous research highlighting the exclusion of gender minorities <br><br>
    from training datasets and the inherent limitations of binary gender classification in commercial AI systems. This <br><br>
    study underscores the urgent need for more inclusive datasets and algorithmic refinements to mitigate bias, <br><br>
    particularly against gender minorities and older adults.</p>
