Main Takeaways:  
- Women, including trans women, are more likely to be misgendered by the algorithm.  
- Men are more likely to be predicted as older.  
- The effect of aging on women is contrasted since cis women are predicted as younger by the algorithm while trans women are predicted as older.  
- Observing an intersectional analysis conveying age and gender, the trans community is more affected, with a lower accuracy rate of the algorithm, while the cis sample has a better one.
