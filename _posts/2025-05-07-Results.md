## Main Takeaways

- **Women**, including trans women, are more likely to be **misgendered** by the algorithm.  
- **Men** are more likely to be predicted as **older**.  
- **Cis women** are predicted as **younger**, while **trans women** are predicted as **older** — showing a contrast in the algorithm’s treatment of aging.  
- From an **intersectional analysis** (age × gender), the **trans community is more affected**, with **lower prediction accuracy**, while the **cis sample has better results**.

## Initial Remarks

We initially thought the algorithm decides the input’s gender based on facial structure, such as cheekbones, jawlines, noses, and chins. Despite the diversity of facial features across our cis and transgender celebrities’ datasets, it was overwhelmingly likely that any input would be incorrectly categorized as a man between 16 and 20 years of age. 
In order to eliminate the angle from which the photograph was taken as a potential confounder, we fed the algorithm 5 pictures from various angles (with or without makeup) of 2 celebrities from our sample. 

Prima facie, we expected that misgendering would be more rampant among cis women than transwomen.

We found that with Zendaya, it doesn’t matter what the angle from which the picture was taken was. So, the idea that the angle emphasises certain facial features (like cheekbones or eyes) and therefore the idea that the algorithm decides based on the softness or sharpness of facial features is not proven. 

Zendaya has high cheekbones and a sharp jawline. Barring the case of merely one photograph of 5, in all angles, Zendaya is incorrectly identified as male, aged 34-45, even in photographs where her features look far softer. This result was consistent whether or not Zendaya wore makeup.

Women (including transwomen) are largely affected by misgendering. In particular, transwomen are most susceptible to both misgendering and mis-aging. Men, including transmen, aren’t as likely to be misgendered or misaged. 

In our sample of cisgender celebrities, only 5 out of 53 women were correctly identified as female, whereas 48 out of 49 men were correctly gendered.

In our sample of transgender celebrities, only 12 out of 104 transwomen were correctly gendered, while all trans men (26) were correctly gendered.

Overwhelmingly, women are misgendered as male. Across the datasets, all non-binary people are wrongly identified as male. The age that is most frequently returned is the range 16-20, with the AI-predicted age seldom being correct. One can posit that any image of a person fed to this algorithm is most likely to be detected as male. 

## Gender Mismatch in Cis vs. Trans samples

The mismatch between real and AI-predicted gender is less in the cis sample versus the trans sample. Trans men are not misgendered at all, while non-binary people were all incorrectly identified.

Having said that, the accuracy for cis women was only about 9.4% (rounded to the first decimal), while it was 20.3% for transwomen - this was unexpected considering the overall predictions of the algorithm. The accuracy for cis men was 97.9% and 100% for transmen.

## Age prediction 

For cis people, in terms of mean age, overall, the AI predicted age is less than the mean real age. In total, the bulk of the results (the 50th to 75th percentile) were predicted as being older than they are. While the maximum age was only around 55, the maximum AI-predicted age was about 75. 

For trans people, the mean AI-predicted age is also lower than the mean real age. There isn’t as much variation in AI-predicted ages as with cis people. The maximum AI-predicted age was around 60, while the maximum age was below 50.

## Who is most likely to be aged up?

NB: to be aged ‘up’ means for the algorithm to predict a person is older than they are in real life, and to be aged ‘down’ means the algorithm predicts one is younger than they are in real life.

To our surprise, when comparing predictions by age and gender, men across the board are most likely to be aged up. The real maximum touches age 50, while the AI-predicted maximum reaches 75. 

![Graph6]({{ '/assets/img/graph_7.png' | relative_url }})

Females are more likely to be aged down than up, while non-binary people are equally likely to be aged up and down. 

What is strange is that while cis women are most likely to be aged down, trans women are more likely to be aged up, i.e., the AI-predicted age is higher than the real age. 

![Graph7]({{ '/assets/img/graph_1.png' | relative_url }})

Of our 5 groups, cis women are most likely to be aged correctly, with a margin of error of 5 years. This accuracy, however, is only 41.51%. Transwomen are next at 33.9% accuracy, They are followed by trans men at 30.77%, and cis men at 22.45%, and trans non-binary people’s ages are accurate in 22.2% of instances. 

## Who is more likely to be correctly gendered and aged across groups?

| Match Type        | Cis Count | Cis %   | Trans Count | Trans % |
|-------------------|-----------|---------|-------------|---------|
| No Match          | 28        | 27.45   | 45          | 43.69   |
| Only Age Match    | 21        | 20.59   | 20          | 19.42   |
| Only Gender Match | 41        | 40.20   | 26          | 25.24   |
| Perfect Match     | 12        | 11.76   | 12          | 11.65   |

Across both samples, the percentage of perfect matches is almost the same, at 11.76% for cis people and 11.65% for trans people. 
Where there is a drastic difference is in no matches in either age or gender - this is 43.69% for transpeople across the board, and only 27.45% of cis people. The difference in the age matching is not much, at 20.59% for cis people and 19.42% for trans people. 
The difference is also drastic in terms of gender matching - 40.2% of cis people are correctly gendered, while only 25.24% of trans people are correctly gendered.
