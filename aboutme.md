- Queer Discriminations
- Facial Recognition

### The story behind this project

We first wanted to work on the algorithms on gampling as they constitute important black boxes. nevertheless, due to the lack of publicly open sources being a strong limitation in our analysis, we were facing a wall. Consequently, we shifted our subject over facial recognition algorithms. As a lot of studies were led on racial discrimination operated by these algorithms, we decided to report our attention to a gender-based discrimination. Following the Queer approach, we put an emphasis on analysing how the trans community is discriminated by these algorithms.

We are benefitting from a multicultural composition over our team, confronting our point of view to produce the best content.
